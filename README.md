# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

Work Day Scheduler is a simple day calendar application that allows the user to input and plan events for each hour of the day. The motivation behind the challenge was to use knowledge that I learned in class regarding DOM navigation, javascript, and some jQUery. I also incorporated moment to display the current date, as well as adding the events of the scheduler to local storage.
